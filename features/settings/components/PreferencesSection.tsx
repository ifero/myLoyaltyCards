              (`light-mode`) until QA pointed out the app was then using two different
              glyphs for one feature, one screen apart: a user sets this row and then
              finds a bulb on the card with no visual line back to it. Worse, the Theme
              row directly above already uses `brightness-6`, so a sun here collided
              with that too. The card button is where the meaning is learned, so this
              row follows it rather than the reverse. Filled rather than outline: this
              is a category glyph, and the switch beside it is what carries state. */}
