 *
 * WHY THERE IS A RASTERISER IN HERE
 *
 * This repo has no image library and no rasteriser — sharp, rsvg-convert,
 * ImageMagick, Inkscape and pyobjc are all absent, and Chrome is not installed
 * for Playwright. `build-splash-icon.mjs` (which this supersedes) established the
 * answer: draw the handful of primitives the artwork actually uses via signed
 * distance fields, take antialiasing analytically from the distance rather than by
 * supersampling, and write the PNG by hand. Cheaper and cleaner than supersampling,
 * and it keeps the build dependency-free so CI can verify it.
 *
 * The Cardì mark needs exactly two primitives: a rounded rect, and a ROTATED
 * rounded rect. Rotation is applied to the sample point rather than the shape,
 * which is exact — rotation is an isometry, so it preserves the distance the SDF
 * returns. Scaling is applied to the shape instead, because scaling a rounded rect
 * about a point yields another rounded rect exactly, and transforming the sample
 * point would have left the returned distance in the scaled space and skewed the
 * antialiasing.
 *
 * It is NOT a general SVG renderer. If the mark ever gains a primitive this does
 * not know about, this script must be updated; it will not silently approximate.
 *
 * WHY THE SVG IS GENERATED TOO
 *
 * `build-splash-icon.mjs` transcribed its geometry from a hand-authored SVG and
 * carried an `assertSvgMatches` drift check to catch the transcription going
 * stale. Generating both from the same constants removes the failure mode instead
 * of detecting it: there is no second copy of the numbers to drift.

  // `watch-android` is a STANDALONE Gradle project and its README calls that
  // self-containment deliberate: it "cannot reach into the JS app's assets
  // without giving up being self-contained". So these four densities were
  // HAND-COPIED, and hand-copying is exactly how they drifted — the phone
  // icon changed on 2026-09-13 and these did not, leaving the companion app
  // wearing the old blue wallet ever since. Generating them WRITES INTO
  // `watch-android/`; the Gradle project still reads nothing but its own
  // `res/`, so the self-containment survives and the drift does not.
  //
  // The Wear launcher masks to a CIRCLE, and the phone's own `ANDROID_SCALE`
  // already clears it — measured rather than assumed. The scaled mark's inked
  // bounding circle is 64.55dp at its WORST density (hdpi, where one pixel of
  // analytic antialiasing is worth the most dp), against the 66dp maximum logo
  // size and the 72dp masked viewport of a 108dp adaptive layer. No Wear scale
  // is needed, and inventing one would break the single geometry definition
  // this file exists to keep. `test/wear-icons.test.ts` decodes the rendered
  // pixels and asserts the containment rather than trusting this comment.
  //
  // There is no `mdpi` bucket and that is not an omission: `minSdk` is 30 and
  // no Wear OS device ships below hdpi, so the bucket would be dead weight in
  // every APK. Android downsamples from hdpi if one ever appeared.
