# Cardì redesign — session carry-over

Rescued from a Claude Desktop session (`809c5078-1eaf-43bf-8079-d4734cbd5808`, party-mode
run started 2026-08-11) whose scratchpad lived in `/tmp` and whose API connection died on
2026-08-12. Everything here was produced in that session; this README is the handover.

| `cardi-design-system.md`               | **The canonical Cardì design system.** Stitch gets a disposable render of this — this repo copy is the source of truth.                                                                |
| `palette-bench.html`                   | Five-direction palette comparison board (01 Ink & Beam … 05 Night Market). Superseded as a _layout_ study, still valid on chrome.                                                      |
| `stitch-prompts-form-states.txt`       | **The four state frames** — default / error / filled / saving. Frame 1 is the exemplar the other seven screens derive from.                                                            |
| `stitch-prompt-01-form-pattern.txt`    | Superseded. The prompt actually sent on 2026-08-11, kept as a record — it describes a screen that does not exist.                                                                      |
| `stitch-prompts-wallet.txt`            | **The wallet pattern** — populated / empty / single-card / no-results, specced against the real `CardList`. Carries eight findings from reading the code.                              |
| `stitch-prompts-settings.txt`          | **The settings pattern** — screen (signed-in / guest) plus the four sheet SHAPES the eight sheets reduce to. Specced against the real `SettingsScreen`.                                |
| `stitch-prompts-document.txt`          | **The document pattern** — prose / searchable FAQ / two-column table. Three screens, three shapes, not the "document (2)" the plan assumed.                                            |
| `stitch-prompts-barcode.txt`           | **The barcode screen** — EAN-13 / QR / not-found. The hero moment, and the last screen to be specced.                                                                                  |
| `stitch-prompts-card-detail.txt`       | **The card detail screen** — at rest / blending / condensed / custom card. The barcode's parent, and the only scroll-linked screen in the app.                                         |
| `frames/cardi-card-detail-frames.html` | **The card detail frames** — four, at 393 × 852. The header follows the brand as a scroll transition: brand → blend → cream.                                                           |
| `stitch-prompts-capture.txt`           | **The capture pattern** — how a card gets in: choose the brand, then point the camera. The only pattern that is a camera.                                                              |
| `frames/cardi-capture-frames.html`     | **The capture frames** — five, at 393 × 852. Choose / aim / no camera / many codes / no code. The one screen where beam is mandatory.                                                  |
| `stitch-prompts-onboarding.txt`        | **The pitch pattern** — the first ninety seconds. The only flow with no user content in it, and the one place the brand speaks in its own voice.                                       |
| `frames/cardi-onboarding-frames.html`  | **The onboarding frames** — five, at 393 × 852. Welcome / modes / difference / first slide / last slide. Where Wave B stopped being blocked.                                           |
| `frames/cardi-barcode-frames.html`     | **The barcode frames** — three, at 393 × 852. The only frames on **white**, not cream; the white field is the product feature.                                                         |
| `frames/cardi-form-frames.html`        | **The reference implementation.** Hand-authored, exactly 393 × 852, all four states. This is what screens derive from — not the PNGs. Open with `?probe` for a measured geometry dump. |
| `frames/cardi-wallet-frames.html`      | **The wallet frames** — populated / empty / single-card / no-results, hand-authored at 393 × 852. Self-contained; shares its token block with the form file by copy, not by link.      |
| `frames/cardi-settings-frames.html`    | **The settings frames** — signed-in / guest plus one frame per sheet shape, hand-authored at 393 × 852. Frames C–F share one backdrop string, so it cannot drift.                      |
| `frames/cardi-document-frames.html`    | **The document frames** — prose / searchable FAQ / two-column table, hand-authored at 393 × 852. No repeated body title; 20px margins.                                                 |
| `frames/0*.png`                        | Stitch's actual output, kept as evidence. Faithful to what the generator produced, including three defects it cannot avoid — see _The 2026-08-15 audit_.                               |

## The thesis

> **The content is the colour.** The home screen already carries ~45 third-party brand
> colours that arrive with the data. Our palette exists to stay _out of their way_, not to
> compete. Playfulness comes from big, uncropped, correctly-coloured brand marks — a
> **layout** decision, never a palette one.

Ink `#181824` · Beam `#FCCC0C` · Cream `#F0F0E8` · Deep blue `#0C3C84`.
Coral / salmon / terracotta / orange are **banned** (the "new" coral `#FF6B6B` was the old
terracotta renamed — and it's Monzo's, on a card app).

The four patterns: **form** (8 screens) · **settings list** (2) · **document** (2) ·
**pitch** (3 + empty state). Wave A is illustration-free (form, settings, empty state);
Wave B is blocked until the illustration set exists.

## Stitch mechanics learned the hard way

- **Write literal hexes into every prompt; never trust a token name.** Material's tonal
  engine turns beam `#FCCC0C` into brown `#735c00` and ink into pure black, no matter what
  the prose forbids. The one screen that came out right did so because the prompt spelled
  every hex out character by character.
- **Touching the design system in the Stitch UI regenerates it** and silently reverts MCP
  edits (the asset reached v5 and restored two rules we had killed). Paste the system in
  fresh rather than letting the UI panel regenerate it.
- **Activate the design system _before_ generating.** `apply_design_system` afterwards only
  re-skins colour; the load-bearing rules (no tab bar, no FAB, label-above-field, 2-column
  grid) live in the designMd prose and only influence _generation_.
- `update_design_system` replaces the whole object — a partial call wipes the designMd.
- `BRICOLAGE_GROTESQUE` is in the font enum but rejected by the backend. Use
  `SPACE_GROTESK`.
- Theme-level `typography`/`spacing` maps are accepted then not persisted — keep them in
  the designMd frontmatter.
- `generate_screen_from_text` over MCP times out **and never lands a screen** — verified
  2026-08-14 with three attempts and 13 minutes of polling. Generation _from zero_ is what
  fails.
- **`generate_variants` is the working MCP route.** Seed it with an existing screen id and it
  returns the finished screen synchronously in the tool result. Use
  `creativeRange: REFINE` + `aspects: ["TEXT_CONTENT"]` + `variantCount: 1`, and describe
  only the delta. See § _UNBLOCKED_ below.
- **Both generate calls take `designSystem: "assets/<id>"` and `modelId: "GEMINI_3_1_PRO"`.**
  Passing the asset id points at the live asset instead of the project's rotting snapshot, so
  the UI "apply" step is not needed to generate correctly.
- **`edit_screens` is the route for a corrective pass**, and it works: it returns a
  `DomOperationEvent` listing every operation with the `verified_html_context` it matched
  against, which is more auditable than a fresh generation. Numbered defects land; the same
  fixes in prose do not.
- **A prompt may not refer to ANYTHING outside itself** — not another frame, and not a shared
  preamble in the same file. "Apply the COMMON CHROME above" does not survive a clipboard, and
  the frame that happens to sit directly beneath the preamble is the only one that comes back
  right. The tell is diagnostic: a shared missing spec produces N _different_ wrong answers,
  not one shared wrong answer, so **frames diverging from each other in different directions
  means a dangling reference, not a bad instruction.** Prompts now carry
  `PASTE EVERYTHING BETWEEN…` / `END OF PROMPT x` delimiters so the rule is checkable by eye.
- **Audit the DOM, never the screenshot.** The returned screenshot is 884px tall so it
  **clips** the bottom of the stack, and it is wrapped in a rendered device bezel. Reading
  defects off it produced three false positives out of seven on one pass — a circle that was
  already there, a bezel that does not exist in the design, and a "missing" Edit/Delete card
  that was merely below the fold. `curl` the `htmlCode.downloadUrl` and grep it. Use the
  render to decide where to look, never as the finding.
- **The written file and the screenshot both lag the edit.** Straight after `edit_screens`,
  `get_screen` still returns the _previous_ file id and the _previous_ screenshot URL, so the
  old content downloads and the edit looks like it silently failed. It has not — the
  `DomOperationEvent` in the tool result is the receipt.
- **`list_screens` OMITS screens that exist — it is not merely stale.** Verified 2026-08-21:
  three calls over several minutes each returned a differently-ordered 27 screens, and none
  included `24ad8fff…`, which `get_screen` fetches happily and whose HTML was audited. So
  exactly two confirmations are trustworthy: **the `design.screens` block** in the generate
  response, and **`get_screen` with a known id**. A generation that **times out** gives neither —
  no id comes back — so there is no way to check it over MCP at all, and the canvas is the only
  authority. Do not retry a timed-out `generate_variants`; it often landed.
- **Stitch ADDS reliably and MOVES unreliably.** In one three-part delta the new node — a banner
  with an absolute offset — landed first time and exactly on the specified 171px, while
  repositioning an existing caption out of a centred flex group failed for the third time across
  two independent attempts. The instruction was wrong, not ignored: _"move it 16px below the
  brackets"_ describes a **position**, when what needs saying is a **structure** — take the
  caption out of the group that centres the brackets. Same class as the standalone-prompt rule:
  when a generator fails the same way repeatedly, the prompt is describing the wrong _kind_ of
  thing.
- **Gemini will not draw a real barcode.** Three passes produced three different fakes: a
  `bg-black` box wrapping a white inner with seven `flex-1` bars, a ~40-bar approximation, and
  a completely empty `bg-primary` rectangle. Nothing in a prompt fixes this, because the model
  is drawing a picture of a barcode rather than encoding a number. The HTML frames compute a
  real EAN-13 from the L/R code tables; treat the Stitch barcode as a placeholder and never as
  a reference.

## Where it stopped

Stitch project `7004325876123157178` ("Cardì"), design system asset `484682383639656270`
("Cardì — Ink & Beam").

### Resolved 2026-08-14 — the primary-action footer

> _"Why shouldn't we stick the add button to the bottom? It's the most intuitive thing."_
> — asked 2026-08-13, answered after the carry-over.

**Yes, anchor it.** The objection it was pushing back on ("a swimming pool of nothing… a
button glued to the floor") made a real observation with the wrong cause attached: the gap
and the anchoring are the _same thing_, and what made the gap read as unfinished was a lone
button floating in cream with nothing marking it as a footer. Decided:

- Anchored bottom footer, separated by a **1px hairline rule** — the gap above is
  composition, not absence.
- **Never `position: absolute`** — a flex sibling below the scroll area, or an
  auto-top-margin anchor inside it when the button must live in scrollable content, so it
  never fights the keyboard. See below: `CardSetupScreen` already does exactly this.
- **Always enabled**; pressing an incomplete form reveals the field errors.

Both are now in `cardi-design-system.md` (§ _The primary-action footer_, plus two new
Forbidden entries) and in the prompt template's FOOTER block.

Two code findings that fed the decision, neither fixed here:

- The app has **two form treatments, not one**. `AuthScreenLayout` — the shared layout for
  6 of the 8 pattern screens — centres its content vertically (`centerContent` defaults to
  `true`), while `CardForm` is top-aligned with the button trailing the last field and
  `paddingBottom: 100` after it. Neither is bottom-anchored, so the anchored footer isn't
  fighting a shipped convention; it's filling a vacuum and unifying a fork. That unification
  is the actual implementation story.
- **Three answers to the screen margin:** `CardForm` hardcodes `paddingHorizontal: 32`,
  `AuthScreenLayout` uses the `layout.screenHorizontalMargin` token, and the DS specifies
  20px. Worth a separate pass.

### Resolved 2026-08-14 — the four state frames, and the label case

`stitch-prompts-form-states.txt` holds four self-contained prompts (default / error /
filled / saving), ready to generate in sequence. States are separate frames because baking
an error into the canonical screen would make all seven derived screens inherit a permanent
red field. Each prompt repeats the full chrome deliberately — Stitch has no memory between
generations, so "same as before" gets a different screen.

**Form field labels are UPPERCASE** (`label-bold`, Inter 13/600/+0.02em). Ratifying what the
generator chose by accident: the tracking already in the token is an uppercase idiom, and
casing the label differently from its value is what lets someone parse the form's structure
at a glance. Checked first that it wasn't a constraint problem — labels are short in both
locales (`Store name` / `Nome negozio`), so it cost nothing either way and came down to
voice.

Writing the prompts meant reading the real screen, which turned up three things:

- **`CardSetupScreen` already implements both footer rules.** Its Done button sits outside
  the `ScrollView` as a flex sibling — a genuinely pinned footer — and it is
  `disabled={isLoading}` only, with validation raised on press (`setStoreNameError` inside
  `handleDone`). So yesterday's decision ratifies shipped behaviour rather than inventing
  it, and `CardForm` is the outlier that gates on `!isValid`. The design system now cites
  it as the reference implementation.
- **The superseded prompt described a screen that does not exist.** It blended fields from
  `CardForm` and `CardSetupScreen`, invented an "Add to favourites" toggle that exists in
  neither, got the labels wrong, and called the button "Save card" when it reads "Done".
  The one generated screen was judged good against that prompt — worth knowing before
  trusting it.
- **The shipped card colours are not the Cardì five.** `CARD_COLORS` in
  `shared/theme/tokens.generated.ts` is `blue #1A73E8`, `red #E2231A`, `green #16A34A`,
  `orange #F59E0B`, `grey #64748B` — against the DS's `#E42424 / #0C3C84 / #0C84CC /
#0C843C / #FCCC0C`. **One of the shipped five is orange, which this system bans
  outright.** This is not a repaint: the `CardColor` union has members (`orange`, `grey`)
  that Cardì has no equivalent for, and existing users have cards persisted against them.
  The tokens PR (step 5) needs a data migration decision, not just new hexes.

### Stitch state, verified 2026-08-14 — the divergence is real, but it does NOT block generating

Read back over MCP. The asset and the project theme have diverged, which is the documented
trap: activating a design system snapshots its designMd into `project.designTheme`, and
later asset edits do not propagate.

- **Asset `484682383639656270` (now version 7) — designMd is CORRECT.** It carries "The
  content is the colour", Card **tile**, `CUSTOM CARDS ONLY`, the Esselunga collision and
  the full Forbidden list. The 2026-08-12 corrections survived.
- **`project.designTheme.designMd` is STALE — it is the pre-correction text.** It still
  says _"The beam motif may animate once across the barcode on open"_ and _"Never a
  two-column grid of cards on mobile"_, still calls the component a Card **row**, still
  marks the accents `DATA ONLY`, and has no content-is-the-colour section at all. Its
  Forbidden list bans two-column card grids. **This is what the generator reads.**
- **The tonal palette is mangled in both**, unchanged since 2026-08-12: `primary #000000`,
  `secondary #375ca6`, `tertiary #735c00` (brown) with `#cfa700` mustard, `surface #fafaf2`
  instead of cream, `error #ba1a1a` instead of `#C41E1E`, `ROUND_EIGHT` instead of 12px.
  The overrides are all set correctly and all ignored. This is why every prompt spells
  literal hexes.
- The asset also carries the competing **`styleGuidelines`** field. It currently paraphrases
  the corrected designMd rather than contradicting it, but it drops the content-is-the-colour
  thesis and the Esselunga collision.
- The canvas holds a **780×1768** frame and a **390×852** one — neither is the mandated
  393×852.

### 2026-08-14 — the push was attempted, and the DS compressed it

Pushed the full repo designMd to the asset. Two new mechanics, both worse than the ones
already recorded:

- **`update_design_system` is asynchronous.** It returns
  `projects/{id}/sessions/{session_id}` — a session, not the asset — and the asset is
  unchanged when read back immediately. It settled about a minute later.
- **The write triggers an agent regeneration that SUMMARISES your designMd.** The asset went
  7 → 8 and what landed is a paraphrase, not the text sent. Casualties, in one round trip:
  the entire **primary-action footer** section, the **uppercase label** rule, the thesis
  sentence _"Playfulness in Cardì comes from big, uncropped, correctly-coloured brand
  marks — a layout decision, never a palette one"_, and six Forbidden entries including both
  new ones and _"replacing the home grid with a single-column list of rows"_. `ROUND_TWELVE`
  was reverted to `ROUND_EIGHT` and the tonal palette is untouched.

Net: **v8 holds fewer rules than v7 did.** The push cost more than it bought.

The conclusion is structural rather than procedural: **the Stitch design system cannot hold
this system.** It compresses on every write, and it drops the longest and most recently
added prose first — which is always the rule you just fought for. Treat it as a lossy cache
of the hard constraints, never the contract. Anything that must survive belongs in the
prompt, spelled out, every time. That is now load-bearing rather than belt-and-braces: the
four state prompts are self-sufficient by design and do not depend on the DS being right.

If it is worth another attempt, send a deliberately **short** designMd — prohibitions only,
no rationale — on the theory that compression is length-driven and a flat constraint list is
the highest-signal shape a generator can be given anyway.

~~Before generating, in order:~~ **This three-step ritual turned out to be unnecessary — see
"UNBLOCKED" below. Kept as a record of the assumption.**

1. ~~Push the current repo designMd to the asset~~ — actively harmful; the push compresses.
2. ~~Re-apply the design system in the Stitch UI~~ — not required for generation; pass
   `designSystem: "assets/484682383639656270"` on the call instead.
3. ~~Re-read `get_project` and confirm~~ — `project.designTheme.designMd` is, as of
   2026-08-14, **still stale** (still contains "may animate once across the barcode"). The
   four frames were generated correctly anyway.

The asset went from version 5 on 2026-08-12 to version 7, and the project's `updateTime` is
today — so something is still editing it. The original desktop session was still running as
PID 24364; quitting it removes one candidate.

### 2026-08-14 — UNBLOCKED. All four state frames exist. The route is `generate_variants`.

The re-apply above was never the only door, and the frames were never actually blocked.
Two findings, in order of importance:

**1. `generate_variants` works over MCP where `generate_screen_from_text` does not.**

| tool                        | seed               | result over MCP                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `generate_screen_from_text` | nothing            | timed out ×3, and **no screen ever appeared** after 13 min polling |
| `generate_variants`         | an existing screen | returned **synchronously and COMPLETE** ×3, under ~2 min each      |

So the old note ("generate over MCP times out; the web prompt box is the reliable path") is
correct but incomplete — it's _generation from zero_ that fails. Generation _from a seed_
returns the finished screen, its id, and its screenshot url in the tool result itself. No
polling, no browser, no login.

`generate_variants` also takes `variantOptions.creativeRange: REFINE` ("subtle refinements,
closely adhering to original") and an `aspects` allow-list — pass `["TEXT_CONTENT"]` and the
tool is _structurally incapable_ of drifting the layout. The set-level bar ("all four frames
identical except where intended") stops being something you inspect for afterwards and
becomes something the call cannot violate. Use `variantCount: 1` — the count produces N
variations of one prompt, not N different states.

**2. Both generation tools take an explicit `designSystem` asset id and a `modelId`.**

`designSystem: "assets/484682383639656270"` points the generator at the _asset_, so the stale
`project.designTheme` snapshot never enters the picture and the UI re-apply is unnecessary
for generation. `modelId: "GEMINI_3_1_PRO"` removes the "check the model selector" step.
This is the snapshot-versus-reference distinction: the UI's _apply_ copies the designMd into
the project and it rots; the API parameter _points_ at the live asset.

(The asset is still v8, still the compressed one, and the tonal palette is still mangled.
It did not matter — every rule that mattered was in the prompt. This is the compression
finding holding up under test.)

#### The four frames, and how they were seeded

Seed chain — each hop asks for the smallest possible delta:
`DEFAULT → ERROR`, and `DEFAULT → FILLED → SAVING`.

| frame     | screen id                          | seeded from | local copy              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |

The PNGs in `frames/` are 711 × 1600 renders committed to the repo because Stitch's
screenshot URLs are ephemeral `googleusercontent` links that will rot. Fetch a fresh, larger
render by appending `=s1600` (or `=s2048`) to a screenshot `downloadUrl`.

Frame 4 is seeded from frame 3, not from frame 1 — it is "identical to filled except the
button", so it should never see the empty form. That is why 3 and 4 are pixel-siblings.

Frame 1 already existed and was already correct; it was generated in the web UI before the
theme divergence was noticed, which is itself the proof that a self-sufficient prompt beats a
correct design system.

**All four judged and accepted, by eye.** Header, labels, field rhythm and the deliberate
empty gap are identical across the set; the error frame's card number sits one line lower
only because the error message occupies a line. Specifically verified: no summary banner or
toast on the error frame, the `STORE NAME` label stays ink rather than turning red, the Done
button is at full ink and enabled in all four, the saving button is a spinner on full ink
with no "Saving" text and no scrim, and the filled frame carries no success ticks or green
outlines.

**The transferable rule:** _generators hallucinate in proportion to how much you leave
undecided._ Seed from a screen, allow-list the aspects, spell out the deltas, and forbid the
specific embellishment you fear by name.

### The 2026-08-15 audit — the frames were measured, and the reference moved to HTML

The four frames had been accepted by eye. Measuring them changed the conclusion. Method:
sample the PNGs with Pillow and take the **modal** colour of a region rather than the most
saturated pixel — antialiasing against cream blends toward the background, so a max-saturation
sample overshoots and invents deviations that aren't there.

| check                         | result                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cream, ink, all five swatches | **pixel-exact, `dmax=0`**, in all four frames                                                  |
| frame geometry                | `711 × 1600` = **393 × 884** — `+32px` against the mandated 393 × 852, identically in all four |
| error red (frame 2)           | **≈`#BF0000`** (89% of border pixels) against a specified `#C41E1E`                            |
| saving spinner (frame 4)      | brightest pixel **`#DDDDDF`**; frames 1–3 reach `#FFFFFF`                                      |
| footer hairline               | `#D3D3C8` vs `#D6D6CB` — within blend noise, fine                                              |

**Stitch cannot draw this frame.** Not "did not" — cannot. It injects
`body { min-height: max(884px, 100dvh) }` into every screen it generates, which is exactly
the +32px measured above. The design system's own Forbidden list bans _"any frame that is not
393 × 852"_, so the generator is structurally incapable of obeying the first rule in the
document. Two further defects in the same output: a `position: fixed` footer (forbidden by
§ _The primary-action footer_) and a back chevron pulled outside the 20px margin with a
negative margin.

**Which of the three are prompt-fixable — settled by experiment, same day.** A
_"Fix ONLY the geometry"_ run was made against the form screen, producing
`1c57d246642e49d596edfc95c8dbb96f`, titled "New Card Form (Fixed Geometry)". It reports
having aligned the chevron to the 20px margin and converted the footer from `position: fixed`
to a natural flex child — so **two of the three defects are ordinary CSS and do fix on
request.** The result is `786 × 1768`, i.e. **393 × 884, unchanged.** A prompt whose entire
and only instruction was to fix the geometry could not move the height.

That is the cleanest available proof of the distinction, and it is worth more than the
original claim it replaces: the chevron and the footer are _mistakes_, and mistakes can be
corrected. The 884 floor is not a mistake — it is the platform, and no prompt reaches it.
**All ten screens now in the project are `height: 1768`. There is no counter-example.**

**So the reference moved.** `frames/cardi-form-frames.html` is hand-authored, exactly
393 × 852, and is now what the remaining screens derive from. The PNGs stay as evidence of
what Stitch produced. This does not retire Stitch — it stays the right tool for _exploring_ a
screen that doesn't exist yet (the wallet empty state still needs a fresh seed). It is no
longer the tool for _geometry and chrome_.

**The literal-hex rule needs one caveat.** Six literal hexes came through byte-exact; the
seventh did not. The difference is not literalness — it is whether the colour collides with a
**semantic role the theme already owns.** `error` is a Material role (the theme holds
`#ba1a1a`), and it is the one that drifted; the card accents, cream and ink own no role and
passed through untouched. Amended rule: _spell literal hexes — and expect the ones that
shadow a theme token to be overridden anyway._

**The safe-area insets are now drawn.** They were reserved at the correct 59px / 34px but left
blank, which made a correct measurement read as careless padding — and invited the actively
wrong fix of shrinking it, which would push content under the live status bar at build time.
The 59px stays; it now carries a clock and indicators, and the bottom inset carries the home
indicator. Both are ink-only system chrome, never beam, and never controls.

The geometry harness that used to live in a duplicate `_probe.html` is now a `?probe`-guarded
block inside the reference file itself — two near-identical 575-line copies could only drift.
Open `cardi-form-frames.html?probe`; expect `size=393x852`, `chevronL=20.0`, `labelL=20.0`,
`inputL=20.0`, `btnL=20.0`, `btnH=52` on all four.

### The regenerated set — 2026-08-15, from the corrected-geometry seed

The canvas was cleared to a single screen, `1c57d246…` "New Card Form (Fixed Geometry)", and
the three states were regenerated from it with `generate_variants` — `creativeRange: REFINE`,
`aspects: ["TEXT_CONTENT"]`, `variantCount: 1`, `modelId: GEMINI_3_1_PRO`.

| frame     | screen id                          | seeded from      | local copy              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1 DEFAULT | `1c57d246642e49d596edfc95c8dbb96f` | the geometry fix | `frames/01-default.png` |

| 3 FILLED  | `6d4cfe6e04794bf093c14dee6ed9e265` | frame 1          | `frames/03-filled.png`  |
| 4 SAVING  | `d39488ce83bc40dfab0a2851e940abde` | **frame 3**      | `frames/04-saving.png`  |

**The spinner is fixed. The geometry is not. The error red is not.** Measured on the new
renders:

| check                         | result                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| saving spinner                | **`#FFFFFF`, luma 255** — was `#DDDDDF`. Fixed.                         |
| cream, ink, all five swatches | **pixel-exact in all four frames**                                      |
| footer band                   | `y=1351..1442` **identical in all four** — the set is truly aligned     |
| geometry                      | `711 × 1600` = **393 × 884**, all four. Third independent confirmation. |
| error red                     | **still `#BF0000`** against `#C41E1E`                                   |

The spinner fix is the transferable bit: it came right because the prompt **named the value
it had drifted to and forbade it** ("pure white `#FFFFFF` — not grey, not `#DDDDDF`"). The
error red did not come right, even though `#C41E1E` was spelled three times in the same
prompt. That is the semantic-token caveat holding under a controlled retest: `error` is a
role the theme owns, and owning the role beats spelling the hex.

**Two MCP mechanics worth keeping.**

- **`generate_variants` can time out at the MCP layer and still land the screen.** FILLED
  returned `The operation timed out`, and the screen existed server-side moments later. Poll
  `list_screens` — **do not retry**, or you will mint a duplicate. This is different from
  `generate_screen_from_text`, which times out and lands nothing.
- **`generate_variants` has no `designSystem` parameter**, contrary to the note further up
  this document. The seed screen carries the system; there is nothing to pass.

**One divergence to hold in view.** The Fixed Geometry seed reserves the 59px / 34px insets
but leaves them **blank** — its own prompt says "keeping the canvas blank as requested" —
whereas `frames/cardi-form-frames.html` now draws the status bar and home indicator into
them. Every Stitch render from here will differ from the reference at the top and bottom of
the frame. That is intended, and the reference is the one that is right.

### 2026-08-15 — the wallet pattern, specced from the code

`stitch-prompts-wallet.txt` holds four self-contained prompts: **populated / empty /
single-card / no-results.** Written by reading `CardList.tsx`, `CardTile.tsx`,
`EmptyState.tsx` and `gridLayout.ts` first — the discipline the superseded form prompt
skipped, at the cost of a whole frame. Four things it turned up that change the system, not
just the frames:

- **The wallet has six states, not two.** `CardList` branches on loading, error,
  single-card, grid, empty and no-results. The **single-card** state — an enlarged 220 × 180
  centred tile with the tip _"Tap + to add more cards to your wallet"_ — has never been
  designed by anyone. Search and sort only exist at `totalCount >= 2`, so drawing them on
  the empty or single-card frame is wrong, not merely extra.
- **The grid margin is 16pt and the design system's 20px cannot apply here.**
  `TILE_WIDTH = 171` is `(390 − 2×16 − 16) / 2`, frozen in `gridLayout.ts` with a documented
  derivation and tests; at 20px the tile stops being 171. **The system needs amending:**
  20px is the single-column (form / settings / document) margin, the grid is 16. This is the
  _fourth_ answer to the margin question in this repo.
- **The shipped empty state violates the system four times** — a per-screen invented
  illustration, accent dots in `#FFCC00` (Esselunga's exact yellow) and `#E2231A` (Coop's
  exact red) used as decoration, a coloured **glow shadow** under the CTA, and a 240 × 50
  centred button where the system says full-width 52px. The new frame is **typographic, with
  no illustration at all** — Wave A is illustration-free, and inventing one here is the exact
  failure the system's illustration rule exists to prevent.
- **The card tile carries a drop shadow in light mode** (`shadowColor: '#000'`), against
  _no drop shadows anywhere_. Removed in the spec; on this screen the brand colour is the
  hierarchy.

Two things came out **right** and are ratified rather than changed: the header is already
`+` on the left and gear on the right, and the tile is already 171 × 140 at 16px radius with
the name in `label-bold` below it. The one header change is the title, still
`navigation.home: 'myLoyaltyCards'` — that string belongs to the rename.

One new decision: **the favourite badge becomes an ink `#181824` plate carrying a beam
`#FCCC0C` star.** Shipped is an amber star on a 95%-white plate, which is illegal in this
system (amber is not in it) and invisible on light brands. Ink + beam is legal and survives
all 57 brand colours, Esselunga's yellow included.

### 2026-08-15 — the parallel Stitch run, and the one idea worth stealing

The four wallet prompts were also sent through the Stitch **web prompt box** as an
independent exploration, in parallel with the hand-authored frames: `6a2c2781…` (Populated),
`2b0c1e6f…` (Empty), `a000f361…` (Single Card), `1d84102f…` (No Results). Kept on the canvas
only — the PNGs in `frames/` remain the form set.

**It got every colour right.** All eight catalogue hexes came back **pixel-exact** — Esselunga
`#FFCC00`, Conad `#DA291C`, Coop `#E2231A`, Carrefour `#004E9F`, Lidl `#0050AA`, Eurospin
`#0069B1`, Pam `#165226`, Decathlon `#0082C3` — plus cream exact and no shadow under any
tile. Consistent with the literal-hex rule, and none of these shadow a semantic theme role.

**One idea beat ours and has been adopted.** Stitch typeset each wordmark in its _own_
idiom — lowercase `esselunga`, heavy caps `CONAD`, lowercase `coop`, tight `LIDL`, light and
wide `DECATHLON`. The hand-authored frames had set all eight in one house style, which is
exactly the failure the system names outright: _"do not unify the tiles — their clashing is
the content."_ The HTML now carries per-brand treatments. They are still stand-ins for the
real SVGs in `brandLogos.ts`; the point is that a stand-in must not flatten what production
actually shows.

**Six things it got wrong, every one of them pinned by the code:**

| defect                                                        | why it is wrong                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No-results header has a **back chevron** and **no gear**      | The wallet is the root screen; `HeaderLeft` is unconditionally `+`    |
| Frames are **711 and 706** wide within one set                | 393 × 884 vs 393 × 890 — the set is not even internally consistent    |
| Empty frame has **dark bars** in the safe areas               | The ground is cream across the whole screen                           |
| Empty subtitle **reflowed**                                   | The real string carries an explicit `\n` after "and"                  |
| **Divider under the header** on two frames, not the other two | The system says no divider — and it contradicts itself across the set |
| **No status bar, no home indicator** anywhere                 | The insets are real and occupied                                      |

**The split this settles.** Stitch is worth running for a screen where its ideas might beat
ours — it found the wordmark point that four reviewers and a written thesis had missed. It is
not worth trusting for anything the code already decides, because it drifts on exactly those
details and it cannot hold the geometry. Explore there, author here.

### 2026-08-15 — bringing the Stitch wallet screens back into compliance

The four exploration screens were then corrected against the HTML so a future illustration
pass starts from a sound screen rather than inheriting the defects. Compliant versions, all
verified by pixel sampling: **empty `7c5de427…`**, **single-card `543cbab4…`**,
**no-results `0dcda2f2…`** — cream `#F0F0E8` edge to edge, status bar and home indicator
present, no header divider. The **populated** screen is the gap: its compliance pass timed
out three times and never returned an id.

Four MCP mechanics came out of it, all new:

- **`list_screens` lags far behind generation, so it CANNOT tell you whether a timed-out call
  landed.** Two screens whose calls returned complete data — ids and working screenshot URLs
  — were still absent from the listing many minutes and several polls later. This corrects
  the earlier note that said to poll it. **Fetch the screenshot URL from the tool result
  instead; it works immediately while the listing is still blind.**
- **Heavy screens time out, light ones don't.** The eight-tile grid failed every attempt;
  the three sparse screens returned in one or two. Budget for the busiest screen needing the
  web UI.
- **`Request contains an invalid argument` is transient** on both `list_screens` and
  `generate_variants`. It is rejected before any work happens, so an immediate identical
  retry is safe and succeeds.
- **A third instance of the theme token beating the literal.** Told _"cream `#F0F0E8` covers
  the ENTIRE frame"_, the generator obeyed for the page and then painted the header
  **`#FAFAF2`** — precisely the theme's mangled `surface`. Same shape as the error red. The
  phrasing that actually fixes it is to **name the component and forbid the token's value by
  hex**: _"the header has NO background of its own; do NOT use `#FAFAF2`."_ That worked in
  one pass — exactly as naming `#DDDDDF` fixed the spinner. **Generalised rule: when a
  literal loses, it is losing to a token with a claim on that component; say the component's
  name and ban the value you keep getting.**

### 2026-08-15 — the settings pattern, and eight sheets reduced to four shapes

`stitch-prompts-settings.txt` holds six prompts: the screen **signed-in** and **guest**, plus
one frame for each sheet **shape**. The plan called this "settings list (2 screens)". The code
holds one screen with two account forks, a separate `LanguageListScreen`, and **eight bottom
sheets**.

**The reduction.** Fingerprinting the sheets by button count and whether they map a list:

| shape                | sheets                                                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pick one from a list | Theme, Language — no buttons; choosing IS the action        |
| Confirm              | Export confirm, Sign out, Import preview, **Delete step 1** |
| Acknowledge          | Export empty, Import error — one button                     |
| Type-to-confirm      | **Delete step 2** — the only sheet in the app with an input |

`DeleteAccountSheet` is a **two-step** sheet (`useState<1 | 2>`), which is why it showed four
buttons; step 2 gates its destructive button on `confirmationText === 'DELETE'`. Every other
sheet in the app is one of these four with different words.

**Three findings that outlive the frames:**

- **The chrome is already a component.** All eight sheets are built on `BottomSheet` from
  `shared/components/ui`, and rows are `ActionRow` — both with stories and tests. Unlike the
  wallet, this pattern is constrained by an existing API and the design must fit it.
- **A fifth answer to the screen margin.** Settings uses `paddingHorizontal: 24`. The tally is
  now `CardForm` 32 · `AuthScreenLayout` token · system 20 · grid 16 · settings 24. The frames
  use **20** and the code should move 24 → 20 — the opposite call from the grid, because 16 is
  _derived_ (the 171px tile depends on it, with tests) and 24 is not.
- **The destructive button contradicts the system.** The system says borderless, `#C41E1E`
  text. `Button.tsx` renders a **filled** `theme.error` block with white text and a border, so
  sign-out and delete are solid red slabs today. The frames follow the system. Separately: the
  variant is an **unguarded fall-through** — `primary`/`secondary`/`tertiary` each get an `if`
  and everything else returns error-red — so any variant added to that union silently becomes
  destructive.

### 2026-08-15 — the settings frames, and a prompt rule broken by its own author

All six settings frames are hand-authored in `frames/cardi-settings-frames.html`. The Stitch
run happened in parallel: `8d208789…` (Signed In), `4602b9d1…` (Guest), `734465a7…` (Theme),
`7bc1305d…` (Sign Out), `9626cba4…` (Export Acknowledge), `6b336e24…` (Delete Step 2).

**The sheets came out excellent and the backdrops came out fabricated.** All four sheet
_contents_ matched the spec — including the hard one: sign-out drew a borderless `#C41E1E`
"Sign Out" above an outlined "Cancel", and delete-step-2 drew the destructive button at
reduced opacity with an empty field. That validates the four-shape reduction.

But every screen _behind_ a sheet was invented, and each one differently:

| frame       | invented backdrop                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Theme       | ACCOUNT / Profile / Security                               |
| Sign out    | ACCOUNT / Profile Information / **Payment Methods**        |
| Acknowledge | Account Details / Data & Privacy, drawn as a floating card |
| Delete      | ACCOUNT / Profile Details / **DANGER ZONE**                |

The guest frame drifted the same way, inventing Notifications, Clear Cache "12 MB" and a
build number, and dropping the Create Account button entirely. "Payment Methods" in a
loyalty-card app is the tell.

**The cause was the prompt, and the rule it broke was already written down here.**
`stitch-prompts-form-states.txt` says: _"Stitch has no memory between generations — so a
prompt that says 'same as before' gets a different screen."_ The settings prompts then said
_"identical to Frame A except the account block"_ and _"the Settings screen from Frame A
behind a scrim"_, four times over. The generator was not drifting from a spec; it was filling
a vacuum the prompt created by refusing to repeat one.

**Rule, stated so it survives:** a prompt may never refer to another frame. Every frame
repeats its own chrome in full, however tedious — the tedium IS the mechanism. When a frame
is "screen X behind a sheet", the whole of X must be in that prompt.

This failure mode does not exist in HTML, which is the quiet argument for authoring there:
frames C–F share **one backdrop string reused four times**, so it is not merely consistent,
it is incapable of differing.

### 2026-08-15 — the document pattern, and the margin question finally resolves

`stitch-prompts-document.txt` holds three prompts. The plan called this "document (2
screens)". The code holds **three screens and three different shapes**, which only share a
margin:

| screen         | shape                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Privacy Policy | **prose document** — title, meta, section headers, bullets, body         |
| Help           | **searchable FAQ** — search field, expand/collapse list, two end actions |
| Data Summary   | **two-column table** — header row, ruled rows, download link, footnote   |

Filing Help under "document" would have produced a wall of text and missed a live search
field, an accordion and two buttons.

**THE SCREEN MARGIN IS ONE NUMBER, WITH ONE DERIVED EXCEPTION.**

| value    | where           | why                                                  |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **16px** | card grid       | derived — `TILE_WIDTH` 171 depends on it, with tests |
| **20px** | everything else | the system default                                   |

`CardForm`'s 32, `SettingsScreen`'s 24 and these three screens' 48 are all drift, and all of
them should become 20.

Two more findings:

- **All three screens set body text at 14px**, against a system minimum of 15px — and these
  are the screens people actually read. Systematic, not a one-off. The frames use 15px.
- **The system has no table.** `DataSummaryScreen` renders a real one and nothing in
  `cardi-design-system.md` describes it. Frame C defines it: **ruled, not boxed** — hairlines
  between rows and under the header, no outer border, no card, no fills, no zebra striping,
  and no colour on the "Not collected" values. They are not a warning and not a success.
- One rebrand string hides here: `privacy.dataSummary.description` still reads "the data
  **myLoyaltyCards** collects".

### 2026-08-15 — the document frames, and where a card belongs

All three drawn in `frames/cardi-document-frames.html`. The Stitch run —
`d22ecfc9…` (Prose), `32b5732b…` (FAQ), `a38494ef…` (Table) — was strong on two of three:
the prose page and the table both came back essentially right, the table correctly showing
"Not collected" in plain muted text with no colour. All three, however, omitted the status
bar.

**The FAQ disagreement was the useful one, and Stitch was half right.** The spec said the
question rows should be bare hairline rules with "no card, no box". Stitch wrapped them in an
outlined container with a **cream** fill — an outline enclosing nothing different, which is
in neither the spec nor the system. But its instinct was better than the spec: those rows are
**tappable**, and everywhere else in this app interactive rows sit on a **white card with a
hairline outline**. So the frames adopt a rule rather than either version:

> **A white card means interactive rows. Bare cream means prose.**
> Help's accordion gets the card; the privacy policy does not.

Two smaller things taken from the run: the table gets a **closing rule under the last row**,
so it ends rather than trailing off, and bullets use a **hanging indent** so wrapped lines
align under the text rather than under the bullet.

**The Stitch screens were then brought into line with the corrected HTML** — prose
`1cd3875b…`, FAQ `045dc4e9…`, table `ddcad879…`. Measured before and after: the left margin
moved from **48px to 20–21px** on all three, and the status bar went from absent to present
on all three. The duplicated body titles are gone, and the FAQ accordion now sits on a solid
white fill instead of an outlined cream box. Each was a single prompt of three or four
**numbered defects** — the phrasing that has landed every time, where the same requirement
written into descriptive prose has not.

### 2026-08-15 — the barcode screen, and the flow nobody had noticed was missing

An audit against the 21 real routes found that the "17 screens → 4 patterns" reduction, while
sound, **did not cover everything.** Five routes belong to no pattern — and they are not a
remainder, they are one flow: `add-card/index` → `scan` / `add-card/scan` → `card/[id]` →
**`barcode/[id]`**. That is the loop the product exists to serve. The reduction was built from
screens that share a shape, and each of these has a shape of its own, so they fell out of a
taxonomy organised by similarity.

The barcode screen was the sharpest omission: the most heavily specified screen in the system
— an entire § _Barcode view (the hero moment)_ plus four Forbidden entries protecting it — and
the only one never drawn. `stitch-prompts-barcode.txt` and `frames/cardi-barcode-frames.html`
now cover EAN-13, QR and not-found.

**What reading it turned up.** The hard part was already right: pure white `#FFFFFF`, true
black bars, brightness maximised on mount and restored on unmount, the status bar forced
dark-on-white, and nothing overlaying the code — `BarcodeFlash` is named for the use case
(flash your card at the till), not a visual effect. **ifero confirmed it works at a real
checkout**, which settled the one question the room could not answer from the code.

Two corrections, and the reason matters:

- **The barcode container's drop shadow and 8px radius are removed** —
  `shadowOpacity: 0.05`, commented _"subtle shadow for definition"_. They were suspected of
  costing scan contrast; the real-checkout test says otherwise, and the shadow renders outside
  the white plate anyway. They go for two smaller, honest reasons: the system forbids shadows,
  and **a white plate on a white field is defining a boundary that carries no information.**
- **Every colour on the screen was off-palette** — card name and number `#1F2937`, hint
  `#9CA3AF`, error `#EF4444`, dismiss `#4B5563`. A Tailwind grey ramp. None of it reads as
  _wrong_ on a white field at full brightness, which is exactly why it survived every pass. It
  is corrected because **this is the screen the system points at when it claims to be real.**

One thing ratified rather than changed: the store name stays in **Inter, not Space Grotesk**.
Space Grotesk carries our personality, and this text is a third-party brand's name — dressing
someone else's brand in our display face contradicts the thesis that our chrome stays quiet.
The shipped code already had this right.

And the hint line **stays**. "Nothing else on this screen" was written against nav, chrome and
ads; "Tap anywhere to close" is the only affordance telling someone how to leave a modal with
no visible dismiss control.

### 2026-08-15 — card detail, and where a brand colour stops being content

`stitch-prompts-card-detail.txt` and `frames/cardi-card-detail-frames.html` cover four
frames: **at rest**, **blending**, **condensed**, **custom card**.

**The header follows the brand — as a transition, not a tint.**

> **Corrected 2026-08-15, after seeing it drawn.** This section first argued the header should
> be cream at every scroll position, because navigation should not wear a third-party brand's
> colour. ifero rejected it, correctly: a cream header cuts a horizontal band straight across
> the top of the hero, so the brand block reads as _interrupted_ rather than as one field.
>
> The argument was protecting something real but stated it too broadly. What is actually
> objectionable is **brand-coloured chrome with nothing beneath it to identify** — and that
> only happens once the hero has scrolled away. So the colour became a transition:

| state     | header + top inset                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| at rest   | **the brand colour** — one unbroken field from the top of the screen to the bottom of the hero, no seam |
| blending  | the brand at half strength over cream, title fading in                                                  |
| condensed | **cream + a 1px hairline** — nothing left for the colour to identify                                    |

The endpoints stay clean — full brand or full cream — so this never becomes forty-five
permanent pastel tints. And **the order matters**: the header stays matched to the hero for as
long as any of the band is visible, because they are one field and a header a shade paler than
the band beneath it reads as a rendering fault. Drafted the other way round it looked broken,
which is why frame B shows no hero at all.

> **"One unbroken field" turned out to be a fact about the markup, not about the colour
> values.** The first draft of the HTML gave the status-bar inset, the header and the hero each
> their own background, every one set to the same brand colour — and it rendered with faint
> horizontal lines at both boundaries. ifero read them as navigation-bar borders, which is
> exactly what they looked like.
>
> Nothing drew a border. The element edges land on **fractional device pixels** — measured at
> `.391` on a 2x display — so a hairline of the _parent's_ cream leaked between siblings that
> agreed with each other but not with what sat behind them. (A computed `outline: 1.5px` on
> every element was checked and cleared: `outline-style: none`, so it never paints.)
>
> The fix is structural rather than a nudge: **one element paints the field and the three sit
> on it transparently**, so there is no second colour left in that region to leak. The seam was
> possible only because _"three things that match"_ is a different object from _"three things
> on one field"_, and the markup was saying the first.
>
> **This is a live hazard in the shipped app, not only in the frames.** `headerBg` tints the
> navigation header and `BrandHero` as two separately-filled views; any layout PR that keeps
> them separate inherits the same seam. The band wants one filled parent.

The controls flip with luminance — ink on Esselunga's yellow, white on the green accent.
`shared/theme/luminance.ts` already does this, though it returns **`#1F1F24` rather than ink
`#181824`**: another near-palette value worth fixing.

Three more findings:

- **The condensed header uses a drop shadow** (`headerShadowVisible`). Replaced with a 1px
  `#D6D6CB` hairline — same job, and already the established pattern for the anchored footer.
- **The favourite star is `theme.warning`** — amber, the same off-palette colour already
  replaced on the wallet tile. It becomes **beam `#FCCC0C`** when filled. One of the very few
  places beam legitimately appears: an active state.
- **THERE ARE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE BARCODE SCREEN, AND THEY HAVE ALREADY DRIFTED.**
  `BarcodeFlash` serves the `barcode/[id]` route; `FullscreenBarcode` opens from inside
  `CardDetails`. Both maximise brightness — the critical behaviour is intact in both — but the
  plate differs: `shadowOpacity` 0.05 vs **0.08**, radius 8 vs **12**, and both use Tailwind
  `#1F2937`. **These should be one component.** Not a design task; a note for the tokens and
  layout PRs, and the reason `stitch-prompts-barcode.txt` alone does not cover the hero moment.

One distinction worth keeping, because it looks like a contradiction: the barcode gets a
**white card here** and **no plate at all** on the fullscreen view. On cream, and tappable, the
card separates the code and marks it interactive. On a white field it would be defining a
boundary that carries no information. Same element, opposite treatment — _white card means
interactive, bare ground means content._

### 2026-08-21 — bringing the Stitch card-detail screens back into compliance

The four Stitch screens had drifted badly, and the shape of the drift turned out to be the
diagnosis. Frame A was close. Frames B, C and D had each invented a **different** card detail
screen: a Notes field and a `Code 128` row and an Edit/Share button pair; a `Remove Card`
button with a red outline and a trash icon; a black `Show Barcode` pill, a copy icon and a
green swatch dot. None of them drew the barcode at all — on the screen whose whole job is to
show a barcode.

**The cause was in this repo, not in Stitch.** `stitch-prompts-card-detail.txt` kept the chrome
and the content stack in a shared `COMMON CHROME` preamble and had each prompt say "apply the
COMMON CHROME above". "Above" does not survive a clipboard. Frame A came back right only
because it sits directly beneath the preamble in the file, so copying it tends to take the
preamble along; B, C and D travelled alone and Gemini filled the gap from its own priors about
what a loyalty-card screen contains.

The rule recorded on 2026-08-15 — _a prompt may never refer to another frame_ — was too narrow.
**A prompt may not refer to anything outside itself at all.** Every prompt in that file now
repeats the chrome and the stack in full and is fenced by `PASTE EVERYTHING BETWEEN…` /
`END OF PROMPT x` delimiters, so the rule is checkable by eye instead of by discipline.

And the divergence pattern is worth keeping as a diagnostic: **a shared missing spec does not
produce a shared wrong answer, it produces N independent guesses.** Frames that are wrong in
the same direction mean a bad instruction. Frames that are wrong in different directions mean
a dangling reference.

Three things learned about the tooling in the process, all recorded in § _Stitch mechanics_:

- **`edit_screens` is a silent no-op**, and so is `generate_variants` when the delta is small.
  Both return a confident narrative and a detailed `DomOperationEvent` listing operations with
  the `verified_html_context` they matched — and write nothing. Five calls, byte-identical
  files afterwards. **The discriminator is the response shape**: a `design.screens` block means
  a real screen was written, a bare `DomOperationEvent` means nothing happened. The corollary
  inverts the usual instinct — asking for _less_ makes a change _less_ likely to land, so a
  one-line fix has to ride along inside a full regeneration.
- **Audit the DOM, never the screenshot.** The returned render is 884px tall so it clips the
  bottom of the stack, and it is wrapped in a device bezel. Reading defects off it produced
  three false positives out of seven: a circle that was already there, a bezel that does not
  exist in the design, and a "missing" Edit/Delete card that was merely below the fold.
- **The semantic-token trap has a second form.** The card-name heading was marked up as
  `font-headline-md`, which the design system defines as Space Grotesk 24/700 — and it rendered
  small and grey, because the utility class does not exist in the generated stylesheet, so it
  silently resolved to nothing. The fix is explicit inline values. This is the same failure as
  a literal hex being overridden by a theme token, arriving from the opposite direction: there
  the token won, here the token was never there.

The compliant set, seeded from frame A and verified at DOM level with nothing missing and
nothing invented:

| frame         | screen id                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| A at rest     | `6d0e19c350fe4c0099fcc96a602f92fe` |
| B blending    | `c617f0b38b724a9fb91ec3b5338538cc` |
| C condensed   | `c0f8371dde504752bc2d776be528124a` |
| D custom card | `96479924cff546be9760cad8fe85234b` |

Four superseded screens should be deleted in the Stitch UI, since MCP cannot delete:
`dc5ce30093d54901a07e4516e919798a`, `aa3f4175af4141bd98a15d4c9a89c4c8`,
`20ea80642a2e4cea8a9a99e7032c090f`, and the intermediate `05e8ea43789240e4bb592782b61c7ac7`
whose star came back as a white outline.

Two things left deliberately unfixed, both cosmetically inert and both inherited from frame A:
a `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)` used as a border rather than a shadow — zero blur,
so it reads as a hairline — and a dead `.esselunga-yellow` rule in frame C that is defined and
never applied. And **Gemini will not draw a real barcode**: three passes produced three
different fakes, including a completely empty rectangle. The HTML frames compute a real EAN-13;
the Stitch barcode is a placeholder and never a reference.

### 2026-08-21 — the capture pattern, and the one screen that can falsify the system

`stitch-prompts-capture.txt` and `frames/cardi-capture-frames.html` cover five frames:
**choose**, **aim**, **no camera**, **many codes**, **no code**.

Reading the code overturned the plan twice before a line was drawn.

**There is one viewfinder, not two.** The plan carried `scan` and `add-card/scan` as "two
viewfinders to unify". `app/scan.tsx` is a bare `<Redirect>` to `/add-card/scan` — a legacy
bridge from the old entrypoint, still reached from `CatalogueGrid`. There was nothing to unify.

**And the scan is brand-_first_, so there is no "brand not found".** This was expected to be the
interesting fork: scan a code, look it up, design the moment it is not among the 45 catalogue
brands. It cannot happen. You pick the brand from a searchable list and _then_ scan;
`BrandScannerScreen` receives `brandId` and shows a `BrandPill`, and the catalogue is consulted
before the camera opens, never after. The custom-card path is a **list row** — "Other card" —
which routes into the very same scanner with `mode: 'custom'`. The door into a custom card was
already built; it just was not where anyone looked for it.

The real junction is **no code / one code / many codes, plus no camera**: five states, counting
three distinct failure reasons in `NoCodeFoundBanner` (`notFound`, `scanFailed`, `pickerFailed`)
and up to six rows in `MultiCodePickerSheet`.

#### The design system contradicts itself here, and it resolves cleanly

`stitch-prompts-barcode.txt` forbids, by name, "a frame, a corner marker, a viewfinder bracket".
`ScannerOverlay` draws corner brackets **and** a sweeping line over a live camera. Both are
correct.

That rule governs the barcode you are **displaying** — your own card, held up to a scanner, where
anything on top of the bars costs you a read. This screen is the barcode you are **reading** —
someone else's code, through a lens, where the overlay _is_ the affordance that says where to
aim. **Same mark, opposite verdict, decided by which way the light is travelling.** The rule did
not need weakening; it needed a direction.

#### And this is the one screen where beam is mandatory rather than banned

The scan line is `theme.primary`, which the design asset resolves to `#000000` — a 2px near-black
line, over a camera feed, under a 40% black scrim. Effectively invisible, and nobody would notice
because the screen still works.

Meanwhile the brand's entire ornament is, in the design system's own words, "a **scan beam**
passing over a barcode", and the barcode-display spec banned beam from that screen with the line
_"the real beam comes from the scanner at the till"_. **On this screen we are the scanner.** The
beam is ours, at `#FCCC0C`, here and nowhere else. The identity's central metaphor has precisely
one screen where it is literal, and this is it.

#### The rest, in order of how much they matter

- **The viewfinder is a square framing something that is not.** `screenWidth * 0.7` is used as
  both width and height — a ~275px square around an EAN-13 that is roughly 95 : 20. And the
  screen **already knows** which to expect: `expectedFormat` is threaded from the catalogue into
  the overlay and on into the scanner hook. A square bracket around a linear code teaches the
  wrong gesture — centre it in the box and you stand too far back, which is the one failure a
  viewfinder exists to prevent. The frames use **300 × 120**.
- **The banner covers one of its own escape routes.** `NoCodeFoundBanner` sits at `bottom: 96`
  while `bottomActions` spans from 0 up to `insets.bottom + SPACING.md` + two 48px rows + a
  divider ≈ **155px**. On a real phone the banner overlaps "Scan from image" — one of the two
  ways out the banner is offering. The frames put it at 171px, clearing the stack with a 16px
  gap. A real bug, not a style note.
- **The failure states leave the dark, and that is right.** Permission-denied and camera-error
  render on cream while the live screen is `#000000`. It looks like an inconsistency and is not:
  same logic as the card-detail header — **the dark ground exists to serve the camera. No camera,
  no dark.** Ratified, not changed.
- **The text shadow stays.** `textShadowColor: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.75)'` on the instruction line. The
  system forbids shadows everywhere; this one is legibility over a background nobody controls,
  the same class of exception as the barcode's quiet zone, where the space is an input to the
  scanner rather than a margin. Ratified explicitly so it stops reading as drift — and it applies
  only to type set directly on the camera feed.
- **Cream, not white, for text on the dark.** Every glyph over the camera is `#FFFFFF`; the
  system's dark mode specifies body text as cream `#F0F0E8`. The corner brackets stay pure white
  — they are a mark, not text.
- **`theme.warning`, third sighting.** The banner puts `warning-amber` beside its message, the
  same off-palette amber already replaced on the wallet tile and the favourite star. Here the
  honest fix is to **delete the icon**: the plate already carries a sentence, and a 20px triangle
  on it is decoration doing no work.
- **The banner's action links are invisible for the same reason as the scan line** — both
  `theme.primary` on `rgba(0,0,0,0.80)`, near-black on near-black. They take the beam too.
- **48px MaterialIcons standing in for illustrations** on the two failure screens. The system has
  no icon at that size (24px on a 48px target), so a 48px glyph is an illustration placeholder —
  the same note the wallet `EmptyState` was pulled up for. Left as a plain icon; illustrations
  are Wave B.
- **Margins drift, third sighting.** `bottomActions` and `centeredContent` are both
  `paddingHorizontal: 24`, joining `CardForm` 32 and settings 24.
- **The brand pill is positioned off the back button, not the grid** —
  `insets.top + SPACING.sm + TOUCH_TARGET.min + SPACING.md`, four values added at the call site.
  It lands somewhere sane today and drifts the moment any one of them moves.

One authoring note: this file's shared frame layer is **extracted verbatim from
`cardi-card-detail-frames.html` by the generator**, rather than retyped, so the token values
cannot drift between the two. Duplication by copy is still the rule — a linked stylesheet dies in
any viewer that inlines the HTML — but the copy is now made by a script instead of by hand.

### 2026-08-21 — the pitch pattern, and Wave B was never blocked

`stitch-prompts-onboarding.txt` and `frames/cardi-onboarding-frames.html` cover five frames:
**welcome**, **modes**, **difference**, and the **first** and **last** carousel slides.

**Wave B has been marked "blocked on illustrations" since 2026-08-14. It was blocked on a
belief.** Four illustrations already exist in onboarding, all placeholders, all built the same
way — monochrome alpha-tints of `theme.primary` assembled out of plain `View`s: three offset rects
on welcome (no rotation, so not a fan at all — a staircase), a 160px circle holding four rects, a
circle holding a rect and seven bars, and one that is just `MaterialIcons verified-user` at 60px.
**The slots already existed at known sizes** — one 200 × 80 band and three 160px circles. The job
was never "design an illustration system"; it was "draw four things into four holes".

And the highest-leverage fix in the flow is not a design question at all: **`BrandedIcon` defaults
to `MaterialIcons name="credit-card"`**, so the screen introducing a brand whose entire ornament
is the ì shows stock clip art. That is a missing asset.

#### The decision this pattern turns on

Onboarding is **the only flow with no user content in it**, and that changes what the palette is
for. Everywhere else "the content is the colour" — forty-five brand colours are the content, so
our chrome stays quiet and beam is rationed to almost nothing. On these three screens there are no
cards yet. Nothing is competing. The quiet was protecting something that is not there.

So this is where the brand speaks in its own voice, and the design system already licensed exactly
that in a line nobody had applied: _"Illustrations: flat, two-tone (ink line-work on cream) with
beam yellow as the single accent."_ One beam element per drawing, never two:

| slot        | drawing                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| the mark    | the **ì** — an ink circle, a white stem, and the grave accent as a short beam stroke |
| welcome     | three card outlines in 2px ink line-work, the frontmost carrying one beam bar        |
| highlight 1 | four card outlines two-by-two; exactly one filled beam — that one is yours           |
| highlight 2 | a card with ink barcode bars and a single beam line crossing them: the beam motif    |
| highlight 3 | export/import arrows, beam on the **outbound** arrowhead. Not a shield               |

Slide 3 mattered more than the rest: its shipped `verified-user` shield promises **security**
while its own copy promises **portability** ("Export and import your cards anytime. No lock-in").
The picture was making the weaker claim.

#### Two things drawing it settled that writing it could not

- **The mark has to be constructed, not typeset.** No font lets you paint half a glyph, so "ì" as
  a character cannot carry an ink stem and a beam accent. It is a logotype; building it from a
  stem and a stroke is the honest approach — and it makes the identity literal: _at rest a dot, in
  motion a beam_, so the accent is a **stroke**, not a dot.
- **The spec asked for beam on the wordmark's accent, and that was wrong.** Beam on cream fails
  contrast, which is precisely why the system pairs beam with ink and never with cream. The prompt
  is corrected: the wordmark is entirely ink and the beam lives on the mark, where it sits on an
  ink circle. Drawing a thing is still the only way to find this class of error.

#### The rest, found by reading

- **`fontSize: 42 - 16`**, left in `ModeSelectionScreen` as arithmetic. It evaluates to 26px,
  which is not on the type scale (34 / 24 / 20 / 17 / 15 / 13). It renders fine, which is why it
  survived.
- **Body text below the 15px minimum in seven places**: the mode subtitle at `footnote`, its
  footer at 13, "What's the difference?" at 14, the option-card subtitle at 14, its eyebrow at 12,
  the "Recommended" badge at 12, and "Skip" at 14. The smallest legitimate size here is
  `label-bold` 13/600/0.02em — and that is a **label**, not body copy.
- **Four of fourteen vertical gaps land on the 8px grid.** Welcome 64/38/6/44/74/18, modes
  30/8/28/34/4, highlights 8/4/20/10. This is the flow that sets the first impression of how
  carefully the app is built.
- **Three consecutive screens, three different top treatments.** Welcome: no header,
  `insets.top + 64`. Modes: a 56px header **with** a 1px bottom border and 12px horizontal
  padding. Highlights: no header but a right-aligned "Skip" at `insets.top + 8`. The frames unify
  on a flat 56px header with no border, and no header at all where there is nothing to go back to.
- **`theme.link` is not in the palette.** All three screens use it. The frames use **ink
  #181824**, underlined only where the link sits inside prose.
- **The recommended card carried a 2px border _and_ a 5% ink wash.** The wash goes: every card in
  this app is white on cream, and a border weight plus one beam pill carries a recommendation
  without making the other option look broken.

### Still open

1. ~~Generate the four state frames and judge them~~ — **done 2026-08-14**; measured and
   corrected 2026-08-15, reference moved to HTML. Do **not** regenerate the PNGs to chase the
   32px: Stitch injects the 884 floor, so a regenerated frame would come back with the same
   defect. That door is closed, deliberately.
2. ~~Design the wallet empty state~~ — **specced and drawn 2026-08-15.** All four wallet
   states are hand-authored at 393 × 852 in `frames/cardi-wallet-frames.html`. Stitch was
   not used: it cannot make this geometry, and the wallet needed a new seed it could not be
   given (generation from zero still fails over MCP). A parallel Stitch run was made from
   the web prompt box as an independent exploration — compare, don't merge blindly.

   One authoring decision worth keeping: the frames are **self-contained, with the token
   block duplicated** between the form and wallet files rather than linked from a shared
   `.css`. A linked stylesheet was tried and reverted — any viewer that inlines the HTML
   (preview panes, the Artifact CSP, pasting it anywhere) silently drops it and renders a
   broken frame, which reads as _"the reference is wrong"_. Duplication is the cheaper
   failure, and neither file was ever the source of truth for those values:
   `cardi-design-system.md` is.

3. **Amend the design system on the screen margin.** 20px is the single-column margin; the
   grid is 16pt, and the 171px tile arithmetic depends on it. Right now the system states a
   single figure that the wallet cannot honour.
4. Re-verify the Stitch design system hasn't been clobbered again since 2026-08-12.
5. ~~The Stitch canvas is ten screens and needs a clear-out~~ — **done 2026-08-15.** The
   superseded decoy (`b1a1e6e6…` "Add Card Form" — barcode format row, "Save card", an
   invented favourites toggle, a baked-in red error, and freshly repainted by
   `apply_design_system` so that it _looked_ trustworthy) was deleted along with three
   unlabelled duplicates and the four original frames. Stitch has **no delete-screen over
   MCP**, so this was done in the UI. The canvas is now the geometry seed, the three
   regenerated states, and the DS text render.

   Still true and still worth knowing: `apply_design_system` is **per-screen only** — it does
   not update `project.designTheme`, which remains stale. There is no MCP path to the project
   default; that really is UI-only, and the canvas is inert to synthetic clicks.

6. Decide the `orange` / `grey` → Cardì card-colour migration before the tokens PR.
7. Three answers to the screen margin (`CardForm` 32px hardcoded, `AuthScreenLayout` token,
   DS 20px) and the busy-button divergence — the shared `Button` greys its fill when
   `loading`, where the DS now says busy keeps the ink.
