# Product Requirements Document - myLoyaltyCards

**Author:** Ifero
**Date:** 2025-12-21

## Executive Summary

**myLoyaltyCards** is a mobile loyalty card management application designed for the European Union market. The app enables users to digitally store and instantly access their loyalty cards across multiple EU countries through a fast, offline-first architecture with true wearable independence.

**Vision:** Transform the payment moment experience by eliminating the friction of managing physical loyalty cards. Users can instantly access their loyalty cards via Apple Watch or Android Wear without needing their phone, network connectivity, or waiting for apps to load.

**Target Users:** EU consumers who regularly use loyalty cards across multiple retailers and brands, particularly those who value speed and convenience during checkout experiences.

**Core Problem Solved:** Existing loyalty card apps fail at the critical payment moment due to two fundamental issues: (1) dependency on network connectivity that causes loading delays or prevents app access entirely, and (2) lack of true wearable companion apps, forcing users to fumble with their phones during checkout while holding items and with people waiting behind them.

### What Makes This Special

**myLoyaltyCards** differentiates itself through three core capabilities designed for MVP market entry:

1. **Offline-First Architecture:** The app works completely without network connectivity. All loyalty cards are cached locally on both mobile and wearable devices, ensuring instant access regardless of network conditions - in basements, rural areas, or airplane mode. No loading screens, no waiting for server responses.

2. **True Wearable Independence:** Standalone Apple Watch and Android Wear apps that function completely independently from the phone. Cards are synced and stored directly on the wearable device, enabling users to leave their phone in their pocket or bag and access cards with a simple wrist raise and tap.

3. **Intelligent Card Sorting:** Smart ordering algorithm surfaces the right card quickly - most recently used cards appear first, frequently accessed cards stay near the top, and users can pin favorites for instant one-tap access. Combined with wearable form factor, this creates a sub-3-second payment moment experience.

**The MVP Value Proposition:** While everyone else fumbles with their phone or waits for apps to load over slow connections, myLoyaltyCards users simply raise their wrist, tap once, and show their barcode. No phone, no network required, no friction. Speed, reliability, and independence at the moment that matters most.

**Future Enhancements:** Contextual card detection using location services, merchant identification, and usage patterns will further reduce interaction time in V2, but the MVP delivers immediate, measurable value through offline access and wearable independence alone.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** mobile_app (iOS/Android) with wearable companion apps (watchOS/Wear OS)

**Domain:** general (consumer utility)

**Complexity:** medium

**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

**Classification Rationale:** 
- **Mobile App Signals:** Multi-platform mobile application (iOS/Android) with native wearable companions requiring offline capabilities, local data synchronization, and cross-platform consistency
- **Medium Complexity:** The MVP scope includes:
  - Multi-platform development (4 platforms: iOS, Android, watchOS, Wear OS)
  - Offline-first data synchronization between phone and wearable
  - Wearable independence (standalone watchOS/Wear OS apps with local storage)
  - Smart sorting algorithm (usage frequency + recency + favorites)
  - Fast barcode rendering optimized for small wearable screens
  - EU multi-country catalogue management (top 20 brands per country)
  - Hybrid backend architecture (server database + JSON delivery for offline caching)

**Key Technical Considerations for MVP:**

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**Speed Breakthrough:** Users display their loyalty card on their wearable device in **≤3 seconds** from decision to display, compared to 8-12 seconds with competing phone-based apps or 10-15 seconds with physical cards.

**Primary Success Metrics:**
- **Card Display Speed:** ≤3 seconds on wearable (wrist raise → tap → barcode visible)
- **Offline Reliability:** 100% functionality without network connectivity - zero failed attempts due to connectivity issues
- **Wearable Independence:** Users access cards without touching their phone - standalone wearable operation

**User Outcome:** Users never miss loyalty points due to slow card access, and consistently complete checkout interactions faster than anyone using phone apps or physical cards. The friction of managing loyalty cards is eliminated at the critical payment moment.

**The "Aha!" Moment:** Standing at a register with items in hand, the user raises their wrist, taps once, and shows the barcode while others are still pulling out their phones or searching through wallets. Speed and convenience become immediately obvious.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Marco - The Regular User at Checkout

**Marco is a 32-year-old office worker in Milan** who shops at his local Esselunga supermarket during lunch breaks. He's always rushed, juggling groceries with his work bag, and hates fumbling for his phone or wallet at checkout.

Marco's standing in line at Esselunga with a sandwich and coffee for lunch. As he reaches the cashier, he raises his wrist and taps his Apple Watch to open myLoyaltyCards. His Esselunga Fìdaty card is right at the top (because he uses it most often and the app remembers). One more tap and the barcode appears. The cashier scans it - done. Total time: 3 seconds. The person behind him is still unlocking their phone.

Later that afternoon, he stops at a Conad for groceries. Same process - raises wrist, opens app, scrolls down one card to find Conad, taps to display barcode. Still faster than pulling out his phone, unlocking it, waiting for an app to load over the store's weak WiFi.

**The breakthrough:** Marco realizes he hasn't needed to pull his phone out of his pocket for loyalty cards in weeks. Even if he has to scroll through 3-4 cards to find the right one on his watch, it's still faster and more convenient than the phone app alternative. No network dependency means it works even in the basement supermarket where signal is terrible. His loyalty points collection is now 100% consistent - he never forgets or can't find a card because of slow loading.

### Journey 2: Giulia - First Time Setup

**Giulia is a 28-year-old marketing professional in Rome** who just heard about myLoyaltyCards from a colleague who raved about how fast it is at checkout.

Giulia downloads myLoyaltyCards on her iPhone while commuting home on the metro. She opens the app and sees a welcome screen explaining the concept: loyalty cards on her wrist, no phone needed, works offline.

She taps "Add First Card" and the app gives her two options: browse the Italian catalogue or add manually. She taps the catalogue and sees familiar logos - Esselunga, Conad, Coop, Carrefour. She selects Esselunga (her main supermarket) and the app asks her to scan or manually enter her Fìdaty card number. She pulls out her physical Esselunga card and uses the camera to scan the barcode. Done. The card appears in her list with the Esselunga logo.

She adds two more cards the same way - Conad and her local pharmacy's loyalty card (which isn't in the catalogue, so she adds it manually with the camera scan, uploads the pharmacy logo from her photos, and names it "Farmacia Centro").

**Her three cards are now ready.** Later that evening, she opens the myLoyaltyCards watch app for the first time. The watch app opens instantly showing her three cards (already synced automatically in the background). In the background, it checks for any updates from the phone, but the cards are already there and accessible immediately - no waiting, fully offline.

**The breakthrough:** The next morning at Esselunga, Giulia uses her watch for the first time. Even though her phone is in her bag and she has no signal in the store basement, the watch app opens instantly with all her cards ready. It works perfectly. She deletes her old loyalty card app from her phone that same afternoon - she doesn't need it anymore.
