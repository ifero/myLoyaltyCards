## Summary

- Overall: 6/7 passed (86%)
- Critical Issues: 0

## Section Results

### Story Metadata

[✓ PASS] Metadata present and consistent.

### Acceptance Criteria

[✓ PASS] ACs cover access points, content, and offline support.

### Technical Requirements

[✓ PASS] `app/help.tsx` and `docs/help.json` specified; offline fallback included.

### Content Ownership

[⚠ PARTIAL] Evidence: Task lists "Author initial FAQ entries (PM / Tech Writer)" — good, but no explicit owner or first set of sample Q&A content provided.

Recommendation: Ask Tech Writer (Paige) to add initial sample 8–10 Qs in `docs/help.json` and include one or two canonical answers as examples in the story.

### Testing & Search

[✓ PASS] Search & offline requirements present — recommend adding a small dataset example and expected search behavior for tests.

## Recommendations

- Should Improve: Include sample FAQs and assign Tech Writer owner; add a small JSON sample file and test assertions for search results.

**Next step options:** all | critical | select | none

I can add a sample `docs/help.json` payload and update the story to include it if you want.
