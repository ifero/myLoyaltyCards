 *   3_000_000 Wear OS APK, production   (`store-upload.yml`)

 * `2_000_040` — the two-counters-one-band collision Story 16.7 documents.
 *

 * is declared in `app.config.ts` but applied as `$((GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER + 1000000))`
 * in `store-upload.yml`, kept honest only by a "must stay in sync" comment. The
 * phone has to do that because `app.config.ts` runs at prebuild and reads a single
 * env var; Gradle has no such constraint, so the band, the offset and the
 * validation all stay in one file with nothing to keep in sync. Do not "restore

 * local one and gets the bare band, which is fine: nothing built locally is

 * not touch it — but it is not a precedent worth copying into a fresh build.
