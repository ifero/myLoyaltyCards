/**
 * Sole entry point of the Wear OS companion app — a thin `setContent` host that wires the
 * repositories and hands them to [WearApp].
 *
 * Manual dependency injection keeps the module's dependency surface minimal (no Hilt). The card
 * store is a **process singleton** owned by [WearGraph] — not created here per `onCreate` — so it
 * survives Activity recreation (see [WearGraph]). Story 10-5 wires the Room-backed store behind
 * Story 10-3's read-only [com.iferoporefi.myloyaltycards.wear.data.CardRepository] interface (the
 * type [WearGraph.cardRepository] returns), so this host cannot mutate card data and the UI is
 * unchanged.
