 * configuration change (locale, font scale, Wear theme) or with the "Don't keep activities"
 * developer option, and creating the repository/scope per `onCreate` would leak a scope on every
 * recreation and reset [RoomCardRepository.cards] to empty (a visible flash while Room re-queries).
 * A single instance owned here survives recreation, so `WhileSubscribed` on the card `StateFlow`
 * stays warm across it. Story 10-6 should hang its Data Layer singletons here for the same reason.
