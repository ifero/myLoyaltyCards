 *
 * It was called `NEUTRAL_GREY` and held `#64748B` until Story 21.2a, which repainted the `grey`
 * key to the azure `#0C84CC` — the Cardì accents contain no neutral at all, so a constant named

 * (`core/watch-connectivity.ts` sends `colorHex: card.color`), so resolving them to the exact
 * palette hex is what makes the watch avatar match the colour the user picked on the phone.
 *
 * ⛔ THE KEYS ARE A FROZEN WIRE CONTRACT, NOT COLOUR NAMES (Story 21.2a). This APK is versioned
 * and released independently of the phone app (see app/build.gradle.kts § versionCode bands), so a
 * key the phone renames but this map has not learned yet resolves to nothing and every affected
 * card falls back to [DEFAULT_CARD_ACCENT] — which is precisely why the phone froze them. Change a
 * VALUE when the tokens move; never add, remove or rename a key. Two are deliberately misnamed:
 * `orange` is the beam yellow and `grey` is the azure.
 *
 * `core/wear-sync-contract.test.ts` reads this literal and fails if it drops a key or drifts from
 * the tokens. That test runs under `yarn test`, which — unlike this module's Gradle job — is not
 * path-filtered, so it fires even on a PR that touches only the phone.
