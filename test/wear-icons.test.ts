/**
 * The Wear OS launcher icon (Story 21.4).
 *
 * **This suite exists because a COMMENT was the only thing holding the invariant.**
 * `colors.xml` declared an opaque white launcher background under a comment saying it
 * matched `app.json`'s `adaptiveIcon.backgroundColor`. The rebrand changed that value to
 * ink and nothing noticed, because nothing could: `watch-android` is a standalone Gradle
 * project that deliberately cannot read the JS app's assets, so the two sides were kept in
 * step by hand. Every assertion below is one of those hand-kept claims, moved somewhere
 * that can fail.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It lives in `test/` rather than under `watch-android/`, deliberately** — the same
 * call `watch-icons.test.ts` makes for the watchOS side. `wear-os-build.yml` is path-filtered
 * to `watch-android/**`, so a PR that broke these by editing only `scripts/build-brand-icons.mjs`
 * would never run it. `ci-quality-gates.yml` is not filtered, and neither is the pre-push hook.
