/**
 * The watchOS accent colour, and the three separate things that have to agree for it to
 * exist at all (Story 21.3, specified by `docs/design/cardi/cardi-watch-grammar.md` §4.5).
 *
 * Both `AccentColor.colorset` files were EMPTY Xcode stubs — `{"colors":[{"idiom":
 * "universal"}]}` with no colour key — so watchOS had no theme layer whatsoever. Story
 * 23.1 decided the value: beam `#FCCC0C`, because a watch runs on black permanently and
 * the system already says primary actions become beam with ink text when the lights go
 * out.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Filling the colorset is necessary and NOT sufficient**, which is the part that
 * cost this story a build to find out. Measured on a 46 mm watchOS 26.4 simulator, with
 * the colorset filled and nothing else: `assetutil --info` showed the colour correctly
 * compiled into `Assets.car`, and `Color.accentColor` on screen was still flat grey
 * `#808080`. `actool` writes `NSAccentColorName` only when
 * `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_GLOBAL_ACCENT_COLOR_NAME` names a colorset, and prebuild
 * generates no such setting. `plugins/with-watch-accent-color.js` supplies it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The story and the grammar both describe the before-state as "system default blue".
 * It is not; it is grey. Same fix, wrong symptom — do not use blue to check this.
 *
 * So there are three halves, and each one alone is inert:
 *   1. the two colorsets carry sRGB beam;
 *   2. the config plugin names them, and is ORDERED so it runs after the targets exist;
 *   3. the barcode screen opts back out, because the accent tints the navigation title
 *      and on that screen the title is the card's name.
