/**
 * The Play Store artwork under `assets/store/` (Story 21.5).
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING ELSE CHECKS THESE FILES. They are uploaded to Play Console **by hand** — this
 * repository has no `fastlane/metadata/`, and every `skip_upload_images` / `skip_upload_screenshots`
 * flag is set in the Fastfile — so no build, no lane and no reviewer's diff ever renders them.
 * That is exactly how they came to sit three and a half months stale wearing the pre-rebrand blue
 * wallet, with the wordmark clipped by the artwork beside it.
 *
 * `yarn icons:check` now byte-compares them against the generator, which catches DRIFT. It cannot
 * catch the generator being wrong about Google's requirements, because it would defend whatever
 * the generator produces. This file is the other half: it asserts the published specification and
 * the brand's own rules against the committed bytes.
 *
 * The specification, quoted from Google's Play Console help and icon design pages:
 *
 *   app icon        512 x 512   "Format: 32-bit PNG"   "Max file size: 1024KB"
 *                   "Shape: Full square — Google Play dynamically handles masking."
 *                   "Shadow: None — Google Play dynamically handles shadows."
 *                   "pick a background colour … that doesn't include any transparency.
 *                    Transparent assets will display the background colour of Google Play UI."
 *   feature graphic 1024 x 500  "JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)"
 *   developer header 4096 x 2304, same formats.
