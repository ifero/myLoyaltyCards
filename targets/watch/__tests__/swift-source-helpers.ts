// shipped source and run them as a standalone program — the symbology contract
// (Story 16.28) for the encoders, and the layout contract (Story 16.27) for the
// barcode geometry. The slicing and the `xcrun swift` plumbing live here rather than
// being copied into each file.

/**
 * Index of the first `signature` occurrence that is REAL CODE — not one inside a `//` or block
 * comment.
 *
 * A plain `indexOf` cannot tell the two apart, and this repository quotes code fragments inside doc
 * comments constantly. A comment that happens to carry a declaration's signature therefore shadows
 * the declaration itself: the slice starts inside the prose, the brace/bracket walk balances on the
 * comment's own delimiters, and the suite validates the QUOTE while the real code below it goes
 * untested — green on a file it never read. Found by the Story 16.41 QA review, which built exactly
 * that decoy and showed the harness reporting `#1A73E8` while the shipped code returned `#000000`.
