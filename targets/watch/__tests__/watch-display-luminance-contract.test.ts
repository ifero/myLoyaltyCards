/**
 * Story 16.26 — hold the barcode readable while the Apple Watch display dims.
 *
 * watchOS exposes no way to force full luminance. Compile-probed against
 * `WatchOS26.5.sdk` at the target's own deployment floor (watchOS 10.0): `UIScreen` is
 * `API_UNAVAILABLE(watchos)`, `WKInterfaceDevice` has no `brightness`, and the only
 * keep-awake property that ever existed — `WKExtension.frontmostTimeoutExtended` — is
 * `WK_DEPRECATED_WATCHOS(4.0, 7.0, "No longer supported")`. `WKExtendedRuntimeSession`
 * links, but it keeps the *app* running "even after the watch's screen turns off": it
 * never holds the display, so it cannot deliver the story's AC2 even setting aside the
 * `WKBackgroundModes` claim Apple's own guidance forbids ("Select a session type based
 * on the app's intended use—not based on the features that the session provides").
 *
 * What the platform does give is NOTICE. `WKSupportsAlwaysOnDisplay` defaults to true
 * for watchOS 8+, so on wrist-down the system keeps this view on screen — dimmed, not
 * blurred — and sets `\isLuminanceReduced`. The symbol is therefore still in front of
 * the scanner, and what the app draws in that state is the one real lever.
 *
 * ⚠️ These tests exist because the OBVIOUS implementation is wrong twice over, and both
 * mistakes are silent:
 *
 *  1. Apple's `isLuminanceReduced` guidance is to "lower the overall brightness of your
 *     view … change large, filled shapes to be stroked, and choose less bright colors."
 *     On a barcode that is destructive — the pure-black/pure-white pair is the signal a
 *     1D decoder normalises its narrow element against (Story 16.23). So the symbol's
 *     ink is pinned here, and following the platform example has to fail this suite.
 *  2. Branching the LAYOUT on luminance re-plans the module — and possibly the
 *     orientation — at the exact moment the wrist drops. `showsValueLabel` feeds
 *     `footerReservedHeight`, which feeds the height the module divides
 *     (`WatchPresentationLayout.swift`), so a naive `showsValueLabel: !isLuminanceReduced`
 *     flips geometry mid-scan. The invariance test below runs the SHIPPED solver in both
 *     luminance states across all seven watches and demands identical pixels.
 *
 * Neither is a runtime display state this suite can observe — that is AC5, on real
 * hardware. What it can do is run the pure policy and the pure geometry solver, which is
 * the same standard Stories 16.27 and 16.37 set for the watch's untested Swift.
