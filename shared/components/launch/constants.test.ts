/**
 * Launch constants — cross-module invariants (Story 16.17).
 *
 * `SPLASH_LOGO_WIDTH` has to equal the `imageWidth` of the `expo-splash-screen`
 * plugin entry in `app.json`, and the story asks for each site to name the other
 * in a comment. `app.json` is strict JSON, so it cannot carry one — this suite is
 * the substitute, and a strictly stronger one: it fails CI if the two ever drift,
 * where a comment could only ask politely.
 *
 * The equality is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. `setOptions({ fade })` is
 * documented iOS-only, so on Android the native splash is removed in a hard cut and
 * agreement between the two layers — same size, same field colour — is the ONLY
 * thing concealing the handoff. Drift converts an invisible transition into a
 * visible flicker.
 *
 * The suite also pins the ABSENCE of a `dark` variant. That is not tidiness: a
 * per-scheme native background cannot track the user's runtime theme preference
 * (it is baked at build time), which is what produced a measured white-to-black
 * launch inversion before the field became scheme-independent.
