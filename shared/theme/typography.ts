/**
 * The Cardì type scale (Story 21.6).
 *
 * Re-derived from `docs/design/cardi/cardi-design-system.md#Typography` and the font rules of the
 * nine app-screen frames in `docs/design/cardi/frames/` — not a relabelling of the Apple HIG scale
 * this replaced. Story 21.6's Dev Agent Record holds the full old-to-new mapping and names what
 * was lost.
 *
 * **The faces are embedded at build time** by the `expo-font` config plugin in `app.json`, so the
 * OS registers them before any JavaScript runs. There is no loading state, no gate to compose into
 * boot readiness, and nothing that can delay the launch hand-off — text is in the brand faces on
 * the first frame it exists. `test/brand-fonts.test.ts` holds the tokens, the plugin entry and the
 * committed files to each other.
 *
 * Typography stays hand-authored here rather than joining the Style Dictionary pipeline in
 * `tokens/` — see "Typography is not a DTCG token" in `docs/design/CONTRIBUTING-DESIGN.md`.
 *
 * Phone only. Neither watch app reads this scale, and by design neither ships a custom face:
 * both keep their platform's system type (`docs/design/cardi/cardi-watch-grammar.md` §5.2).
