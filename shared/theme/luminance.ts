 * The design system wants beam: on the card-detail screen the star "is the only

 * one — Esselunga is `#FFCC00`, three points from beam `#FCCC0C`, and it is
 * likely the most-used card in the app, so a beam star on an Esselunga header
 * is invisible rather than subtle. Falling back to ink keeps the star legible
 * and keeps the filled/outline distinction doing the work of saying
 * "favourite", which is the part the user actually reads.
 *
 * This also pre-answers a collision Story 21.2a creates one wave later: it
 * makes beam itself a user-pickable card accent, and a beam field resolves here
 * to an ink star by the same rule, with no further change.
 *
 * Only the *filled* (favourited) state goes through here. The unfavourited
 * outline star follows the field's own foreground via `getContrastForeground`.
